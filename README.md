Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Journey** repository! 
This repo is a collection of all my practice exercises, 
assignments, and projects as I explore and master JavaScript. 
From the very basics to more advanced concepts, I aim to build
 a strong foundation in JavaScript and use it in real-world projects.
